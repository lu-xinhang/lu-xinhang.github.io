<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This tutorial will introduce both classic and recent results on fair resource allocation.
To start, we will outline prominent fairness notions when allocating divisible (commonly known as "cake cutting") and indivisible resources and their properties in respective settings.
Moving on, we will focus on recent developments in the line of work that combines both divisible and indivisible resources.
First, we will discuss fair division with money, in which money can be viewed as a homogeneous divisible good.
We will next touch on the axiomatic study of fairness when allocating a mix of divisible and indivisible resources.
</p>

<p>
The last part of this tutorial will focus on matching algorithms and their properties.
Specifically, we will examine important solution concepts and axiomatic properties such as individual rationality, Pareto efficiency, core stability, and strategyproofness.
We will also explore fundamental matching algorithms including Kuhn's algorithm, Gale's TTC algorithm and the Deferred Acceptance algorithm.

<p>
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/">Toby Walsh</a> is a leading researcher in Artificial Intelligence.
He is a Laureate Fellow and Scientia Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW Sydney, and he is also an adjunct fellow at CSIRO Data61.
He was named by the Australian newspaper as a "rock star" of Australia's digital revolution.
He has been elected a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, a fellow of the ACM, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence.
